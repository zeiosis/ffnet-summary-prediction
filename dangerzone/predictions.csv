Guest Message: My best friend whom I harbor affections for kissed me last night, but due to his special condition he does not recall a single moment of it. I am quite conflicted about whether to disclose these events to him or not, because that would most certainly require me to confess my feelings as well. If anyone has experience in romancing boys with excessive positive energy, this one humbly asks you to share some advice.

The game has since been adopted into a drinking game by bored young adults similarly trapped inside those cold, dark grueling months. The game’s rules go something like this. Each person takes a turn telling two truths and one lie about themselves while the rest of the participants have to pluck out the lie. If the guessers guessed wrong, the person telling the information gets the point. If the guesser guessed right, then the person gets no points.  There is no real end to this game.

I’ve heard of raving reviews regarding this book, but I’ve never really come around to reading it until this afternoon. Needless to say, I am now crying my eyes out and writing this review with sixteen wet tissues stuck to my keyboard. You’re welcome.
Whoever told me this wasn’t a romance book was a goddamn liar. This entire thing is a love confession. The whole Liyue arc was a goddamn love confession. Holy shit. Was it really supposed to be a historical book? I kept trying to read and re-read it again, but nope, all I saw was two really gay, constipated people who just kept jumping around each other and - when they finally got the chance to confess!!!! - got screwed over by the universe.
