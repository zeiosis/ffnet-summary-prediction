Please Forget-Me-Not by Ktkat9 reviews
It was just a stupid story his brother told him to get him to help with the garden. Forget-Me-Nots didn't actually hold memories, and destroying them didn't make those memories fade.

Especially when life tries to make you forget.

Just a story prompt idea that I wanted to make into a story but got stuck on what to write.

The Last Jedi Alternate Ending by Shargonath reviews
AE where, after defeating Snoke, Rey accepts Ben's offer to join sides instead of rejecting him outright.

Unfortunately I lost the file, but recently found it again & revised it so that it connects with ROS.

Alone in the Sunset by Princess of Words reviews
It was all so cut and dried on paper, Wanda thought. The brief, formal words carried no hint of the emotion and tragedy involved in the events they described. No hint of Vision's hopes for the future when he'd ordered the construction of a home begun. No sign of the war and terror that had claimed their lives only minutes apart. Set pre-WandaVision but contains SPOILERS.

This is a character study set pre-series (AU style of course). I do believe that Sam had a lot of mental health issues growing up in a life that he hated.

So that's pretty much what this is, enjoy.

Good in Goodbye by QueenMimi96 reviews
Sometimes there's good in goodbyes - cheesy, I know, but it's true. Another truth? Therapy can also come in the form of heartbreak, cathartic if you will when you can let all your feelings out. And Jack, my very best friend, would always be my shoulder to cry on...and maybe more. One-shot.

Colds & Batman by QueenMimi96 reviews
Colds were the worst - I couldn't breathe, my nose looked like Rudolph's and worst of all, I was running out of movies to watch while in 'quarantine'. That was...until Jack came along, asserting himself as my personal nurse. It helped that he was a very attractive nurse. One-shot.

One Little Parody by QueenMimi96 reviews
It was only one little video...that turned into a few little videos. It was all meant for fun, really. But apparently, some videos were not meant for Jack's innocent eyes. Especially when they involved the Ghostbusters theme song and a laughable parody. One-shot.

Hey, Roomie by QueenMimi96 reviews
A bad break-up leads to crashing with the Winchesters for a couple of weeks. To be honest, they weren't totally of the mind to let Crowley's daughter live in the Bunker. Then again, that was before they had a super attractive nephilim staying with them. And him? Well, he could be persuaded. One-shot.

Fourth of July with the Winchesters was even better than I thought it would be. And now that Jack had joined our little group, even more so. We'd become fast friends.

I'm Sorry For Myself by QueenMimi96 reviews
I could barely breathe with him gone. It wasn't his fault and I knew it - Dean's words had a way of hitting harder than intended sometimes. But I couldn't deny that I missed Jack, that I felt empty without him. He'd become my constant, my everything. So why did he leave me here? One-shot.

The Perfect Ornament by QueenMimi96 reviews
Decorating for Christmas with Team Free Will in the bunker was always a happy affair. Especially for Jack since this would be his first Christmas. He had a lot to learn though - like not eating the popcorn to string on the tree. But when an ornament from a long-forgotten Winchester Christmas catches his eye, it may be enough to teach him the true meaning of the holiday. One-shot.

Teaching Lessons by QueenMimi96 reviews
Jack needs to know the basics so I took it upon myself to help him out. After all, simple lessons like teen slang and celeb gossip shouldn't be so hard, right? Wrong. Because apparently, a lesson on kissing is exactly what Jack thinks he needs. In retrospect? I probably shouldn't have let him watch so much TV. One-shot.

Jack's first Thanksgiving was going to be special, we would all see to that. But Thanksgiving is so much more than just turkey, pumpkin pie, and family time. Jack needed to know the history, not just the sugar-coated pilgrim pictures pasted into a textbook. One-shot.

The Greek Hunter by QueenMimi96 reviews
Being a Greek hunter in America wasn't exactly easy. First off, next to no one knew how hard it was to take down a Minotaur or a Chimera. Even though he didn't understand fully though, Jack accepted me. It was more than I'd hoped for...but will friendship turn into something so much more? One-shot.

Nephilim Shuts His Cake-Hole  by QueenMimi96 reviews
It was clear Jack needed a day off from the hunter lifestyle. Dean had yet to give him a break and I could see it was starting to wear on him. So a trip to the cake shop sounded like the best idea. Although, maybe stealing Dean's car, Baby, to drive there in was not such a good idea? Two-shot.

Faith's Hopeful Tricks  by siriusly-sly reviews
An exploration of what could have happened in Season 3, had Buffy spent a little less time obsessing over Angel, and a lot more time with Faith. Told mostly from Faith's perspective, it takes a lot of subtext and turns it into text text. This story is (pretty PG) femmeslash.
